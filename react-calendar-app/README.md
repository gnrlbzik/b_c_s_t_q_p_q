## React Calendar App
Make a calendar app. The calendar should display all the dates for the current month. The calendar app should also be able to mark appointments. The app must have the following functionality:

- Any appointment can be made for the current day or for a future date.
- No two appointments should overlap.
- If an appointment already exists for a day, a warning should be shown.
- Appointments can be edited and deleted.
